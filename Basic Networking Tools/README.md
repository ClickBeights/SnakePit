# Basic Networking Tools
This chapter explained fundamental scripts that set the stage for next tools.  

  
## TCP Client/Server & UDP Client
The first 3 tools are for testing and understanding communiation between a client and a server.
Of course there is plenty of room for improvement.  

  
## Python NetCat
Simply because the known netcat may be flagged, if you are lucky enough to have python on the compromised machine, you can run this.  

  
## TCP Proxy
This one hasn't been tested properly yet. However, it does have placeholders for editing intercepted requests and responses.


## SSH Client, Reverse-Client, and the Server
1. The client will run 1 command and shutdown. It was created to mainly test things out and learn.
2. The Reverse-Client works with the server. After authentication, all commands are executed from the server, like netcat, bu encrypted basically.
