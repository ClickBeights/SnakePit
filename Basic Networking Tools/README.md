# Basic Networking Tools
This chapter explained fundamental scripts that set the stage for next tools.  

  
## TCP Client/Server & UDP Client
The first 3 tools are for testing and understanding communiation between a client and a server.
Of course there is plenty of room for improvement.

  
## Python NetCat
This is no where near netcat, but get's the job done to some extent

  
## TCP Proxy
This one hasn't been tested properly yet.
