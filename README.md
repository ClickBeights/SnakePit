# Collection of Python Scripts
This repository is collection of offensive python scripts I find on the internet, some modified, other just pasted here for my personal use and quick access. You may find a lot of comments in these scripts, they help me get back on track faster if I want to edit anything. 
 
# Resources
The main resource for this repository was BHP-2ED, you can find all the original scripts in the book mentioned below (Yes Free). However, I found that many of these script do not match the script in the book, there were typos, and snippets that did not work properly (e.g. Python Netcat cannot run "cd" command when in interactive mode). I tried to preserve the original scripts and making as less adjustments as possible, but in many cases it was not possible (e.g. GitHub C2 changed the whole "GitImporter" class because it simply did not work). Most of the scripts in this repository have been modified to work as expected.
