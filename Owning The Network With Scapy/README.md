## Scapy

This section demonstrates one of the most used netowrk modules <b>Scapy</b>. The first script shows a basic network sniffer that retrieves clear text email and password if 
the user/pass fields match the ones we defined in the script. Furthermore, it shows how 1 module can save us many lines as this script also sniffs the network, but without the 
decoding overhead.
