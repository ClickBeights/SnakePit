## Sniffer Scapy 

This section demonstrates one of the most used netowrk modules <b>Scapy</b>. The first script shows a basic network sniffer that retrieves the first packet it sniffs and 
prints out detailed information broken down in sections by the module.  

## Sniffing Clear Text Credentials

The second script on the list <b>2.Mail_Sniffer.py</b> clear text email and password if the user/pass fields match the ones we defined in the script. Furthermore, it shows 
how 1 module can save us many lines as this script also sniffs the network, but without the decoding overhead.
